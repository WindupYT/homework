    </div>

    <p id="text2"> In the UK in the early 1980s, <a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/8091744/">hacking was not prohibited</a>. Although some institutions made it clear that hacking, particularly when it resulted in data file damage, was a disciplinary offence, there was no legal framework within which a criminal case could be brought. <br/>
        <br/> The UK's Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is a piece of legislation created to combat hacking and data misuse on computers. Unauthorised access, acts on data, and acts with the intent to commit additional crimes are all made illegal. For those found guilty of computer-related offences, the Act imposes penalties, including fines and imprisonment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li> The maximum penalty on indictment for unauthorised access to computer material carries a penalty of up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-misuse-act#:~:text=The%20Computer%20Misuse%20Act%201990%20creates%20three%20distinct%20criminal%20offenses%3A&text=Unauthorized%20access%20to%20computers%2C%20including,dealt%20with%20by%20a%20magistrate.">six months’ imprisonment or up to a £5000 fine</a> and will be dealt with by a magistrate.</li>
            <li> The maximum penalty on indictment for unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences is <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/computer-misuse-act">5 years imprisonment</a>.</li>
            <li>The maximum sentence on indictment for unauthorised acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing the operation of a computer is 10 years' imprisonment.</li>
            <li>The maximum sentence on making or supplying articles for use in computer misuse offences is <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/computer-misuse-act">10 years' imprisonment</a> and/or an <a href="https://cyfor.co.uk/the-computer-misuse-act-and-cyber-crime/">unlimited fine</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <p id="text2">Its provisions aid in protecting digital infrastructure and data, discouraging cybercrimes, and shielding people, companies, and governmental institutions from nefarious actions. <br/>
        <br/> Therefore, a key piece of UK legislation, the Computer Misuse Act 1990, was developed to address the growing danger of unauthorised access to and misuse of computer systems and data. Unauthorised access and actions involving computer data without the appropriate authorization are prohibited by this Act. The Act effectively deters cybercrimes by imposing penalties for offenders, including fines and imprisonment. It is essential for protecting digital infrastructure, shielding people and organisations from harmful actions, and guaranteeing the reliability and security of computer systems. The Computer Misuse Act remains an essential tool in thwarting cyberthreats and fostering a safer online environment for everyone as technology advances. </p>
