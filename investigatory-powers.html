            <p id="text2">...this directive clarifies the legal requirements of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</a> (RIPA). RIPA creates a framework to guarantee that investigative tactics are utilised properly, proportionately, and with due regard for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">ECHR's Article 8</a> right to respect for one's private and family life <br/>
                <br/>The act regulates the <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/privacy-and-data/investigatory-powers-act#:~:text=The%20Regulation%20of%20Investigatory%20Powers,the%20discharge%20of%20their%20functions.">following areas</a>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Directed surveillance.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Directed surveillance is the term for covertly watching people or their actions with the goal of learning personal information about them. It entails covertly monitoring someone's interactions or movements without that person's awareness. This type of monitoring is used for particular investigations or operations, and RIPA authorization is required to guarantee that it is legal and proportionate.</li>
                    <br/>
                        <li>Intrusive Surveillance.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Similar to directed surveillance, intrusive surveillance entails covert monitoring or observation, but it is more invasive since it may use invasive techniques, including utilising surveillance devices, to learn personal information about a person. To ensure that it is carried out legally and within reason, it must be done with the right licence and for specified investigative goals.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS).<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Informants or undercover agents, that is, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covert-human-intelligence-sources-code-of-practice-2022/covert-human-intelligence-sources-revised-code-of-practice-accessible#:~:text=Definition%20of%20a%20covert%20human%20intelligence%20source%20(CHIS)&text=they%20covertly%20use%20such%20a,existence%20of%20such%20a%20relationship.">Covert Human Intelligence Sources</a>,Â are examples of people who disclose information to public authorities covertly and without the target of the investigation being aware of it. RIPA controls the usage of CHIS to make sure it is ethical and appropriate. To protect the rights of both the informant and the target of the inquiry, the use of CHIS requires the appropriate authorisation. <br/> </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Intercepting Communications. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Accessing and monitoring private communications, such as phone calls, emails, or letters, without the recipients' knowledge or agreement, is known as <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/interception-of-communications#:~:text=The%20interception%20of%20communications%20includes,target%27s%20letters%20or%20e%2Dmails.">"intercepting communications."</a> The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act of 2000 (RIPA) regulates this activity to guarantee that it is conducted out legally and with the proper protections to preserve people's rights to privacy. Public authorities must obtain the proper authorisation before using this intrusive surveillance method to ensure its legal and responsible application in certain operational or investigation contexts.<br/> </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Communications data does not contain the substance of the communication itself, but rather information about the sender, recipient, time, and place of communications. RIPA controls how public agencies can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-the-acquisition-and-disclosure-of-communications-data">obtain and share communications data</a>, ensuring that these actions are legal and that the necessary measures are taken to preserve people's private rights.</li>
                </ol>

                <p id="text2">All in all, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</a> strives to achieve a balance between protecting people's privacy and their rights while enabling effective law enforcement and intelligence gathering.  By providing a legal framework and rigorous authorisation procedures for these operations, RIPA seeks to ensure that investigative techniques are used in a lawful, required, and acceptable manner.</p>
